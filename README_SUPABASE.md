# Supabase Setup - Quick Guide

Your app has been successfully migrated to use Supabase instead of MySQL!

## What Changed

✅ **Removed**: MySQL connection code  
✅ **Added**: Supabase integration directly in `main.py`  
✅ **Kept**: All existing function names and behavior  
✅ **Local**: SQLite still works for offline data

## One-Time Setup Required

### Step 1: Create Database Tables (5 minutes)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Open `supabase_schema.sql` and copy all the SQL code
6. Paste it into the SQL Editor
7. Click **Run** or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter

That's it! Your tables are now created.

### Step 2: Verify Setup

Run this to test your connection:
```bash
cd Galapagos-2025
python3 -c "from supabase_config import test_connection; print('✅ Connected!' if test_connection() else '❌ Failed - run the SQL first')"
```

### Step 3: Run Your App

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## What Works Now

- ✅ User registration & login (cloud database)
- ✅ GPS tracking (local + cloud sync)
- ✅ Trip statistics (cloud database)
- ✅ Offline support (local SQLite)
- ✅ All existing features preserved

## Files

- `main.py` - Your main app (now using Supabase)
- `supabase_config.py` - Connection credentials
- `supabase_schema.sql` - Database setup SQL

## Need Help?

If tables don't exist, you'll see "Connection failed - tables may not exist yet"  
→ Just run the SQL in Supabase Dashboard (Step 1 above)

---

**That's it! Your app now uses Supabase cloud database.** 🎉
